## EMPTY STRING issue
While I was handling null values of the dataset, I found there were companies whose industry were missing. I tried to SELF JOIN the table and find out which company is missing industry using below approach 

SELECT t1.company, t1.industry,t2.company, t2.industry
FROM layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

I was not getting any results when I ran this query. Then I did some debugging and found that the column contained empty string that's why `t1.industry = ''` was not returning value

Solution: Use of TRIM function

SELECT t1.company, t1.industry,t2.company, t2.industry
FROM layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR TRIM(t1.industry) = '')
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL
AND TRIM(t2.industry) <> '';

BINGO!! Now it works
